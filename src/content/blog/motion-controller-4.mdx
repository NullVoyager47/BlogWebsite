### Dissasembling the blaster

For this post I'll be taking a break from the technical side of things and getting the nerf blaster ready to add the components. This will include making enough space inside the blaster for the pro micro and gyroscope, as well as drilling holes for all of the buttons.

I started by dissasembling the blaster, removing all of the screws and separating the two halves of the shell. I then removed the internal firing mechanism, which was simply a matter of unscrewing all of the plastic parts. The most important part of this step was to document the dissasembly thoroughly, to make it easy to reassemble if needed.

To start with I mapped out where on the blaster I was going to put the components. The trigger button will obviously be placed behind the trigger so that it is pressed when the trigger is pulled.
