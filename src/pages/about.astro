		Hello there! I'm Rufus Reed, a computer science student currently studying at the University of Leicester. Over the past few years, my focus has been on software and programming, particularly game development, but recently I've been getting into electronics as well. I decided to start this blog to document my journey as a complete beginner to electronics, in the hopes that someone may find it interesting or educational, as well as for me to be able to look back on my progress.
